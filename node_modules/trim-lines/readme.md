## What is this?

This package is a tiny utility that removes spaces and tabs around line endings,
keeping the line endings, and not removing whitespace at the start or end of the
string.
It might look trivial, but it’s actually pretty complex to get performant.

## When should I use this?

When you need to trim markdown-like whitespace around line endings and don’t
want to run into performance problems.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm]:

```sh
npm install trim-lines
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import trimLines from 'https://esm.sh/trim-lines@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

<script type="module">
  import trimLines from 'https://esm.sh/trim-lines@3?bundle'
</script>
```

import {trimLines} from 'trim-lines'

console.log(trimLines(' foo\t\n\n bar \n\tbaz ')) // => ' foo\n\nbar\nbaz '
```
