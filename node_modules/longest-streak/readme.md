## What is this?

This is a tiny package that finds the count of the longest adjacent repeating
substring.

## When should I use this?

This package is rather niche.
I use it for serializing markdown ASTs (particularly fenced code and math).

You can use [`ccount`][ccount] if you need the total count of substrings
occuring in a value.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+), install with [npm]:

```sh
npm install longest-streak
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {longestStreak} from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {longestStreak} from 'https://esm.sh/longest-streak@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {longestStreak} from 'longest-streak'

longestStreak('` foo `` bar `', '`') // => 2
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `longestStreak`.
There is no default export.

### `longestStreak(value, substring)`

Get the count of the longest repeating streak of `substring` in `value`.

###### Parameters

- `value` (`string`) — content to search in
- `substring` (`string`) — substring to look for, typically one character

###### Returns

Count of most frequent adjacent `substring`s in `value` (`number`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+.
It also works in Deno and modern browsers.

## Security

This package is safe.
